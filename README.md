# Intro to Docker

An opinionated introduction to using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as a software development tool

> Disclaimer: This is a collection of examples of how you _can_ use Docker as a supporting tool for software development. I make no claim as to if this follows best practices of software engineering. Exploration of uses on your own should be considered mandatory follow-up to reading.

## Requirements

- A computer with Docker installed on it

### Installation

To install Docker Community Edition on your Linux, Mac, or Windows machine follow the [instructions in the Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

## Documentation

The [official Docker documentation and tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) can be found on the Docker website. It is quite thorough and useful. It is an excellent guide that should be routinely visited, but the emphasis of this introduction is on using Docker, not how Docker itself works.

## Tutorial

### What is a Docker image?

It is still important to know what Docker _is_ and what the components of it _are_.

### Pulling Images
